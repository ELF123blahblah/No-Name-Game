# Ping-Pong-Game
I am learning how to code and make games. This is my first no tutorial, no guide game that I am making. Currently my drawing skills are not good so I go the assets online. Hope you enjoy
# Day 1

Today I decided on what the game name and what game I would do. Which is a simple pong game. This might seem little small because it is. For me that is okay cause I am just starting to learn.
