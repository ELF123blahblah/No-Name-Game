# Too fast to catch(Journal/Dev log)

This is my first time making a game without following any tutorials. So don’t expect much. Currently as I am starting this project I won’t be commit my 100% as I am also working on a hackpad. I have decided to draw every bit of asset I need for the game. I quite don’t know the specific term for the style of art I am going to do but as I said it’s all gonna be hand drawn.
